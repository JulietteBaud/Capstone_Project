# Introduction of the project
 
## Introduction of the problem 
All around the world people are changing their food habits. More and more are becoming vegetarians and vegans. With this change restaurants also have to adapt and propose more solutions for clients with different needs. But even with the increasing demand a lot of vegetarian/vegan restaurants are closing only a few months after opening. This can be due to different factors; the restaurant doesn't offer enough variety and therefore non vegetarian or vegan client are not finding something they like when accompanying their vegetarian friends. Also, the restaurant might be located in an area where the demand is low because there is already too much restaurants proposing this kind of option. Some neighborhood might be more friendly to this type of places because other types of venues are attracting the same clientele around.

## Goal of the analysis
The goal of this project will be to evaluate the different neighborhoods of Brooklyn, New York and analyze the top venues of each one to determine if there is a more suitable neighborhood to implant a new vegetarian/vegan restaurant. 

## Interested parties 
People in the restaurant business, interested in new food habits are targets to the analysis. 

# Data used 

The source of data that will be used is Foursquare. The target area for the opening of the restaurant is Brooklyn, New York. In Foursquare different information are available. The venues listed in different Neighbourhoods, their names, their categories, the ratings of the places. Data about already existing vegetarian and vegan restaurants will be used as well as information about other type of restaurant around. For example, a neighbourhood with only fast food and steak house around might not attract the type of clients we are targeting. Also, information about other type of venues can be used, such as yoga studios and art galleries. This type of places tends to attract a more vegetarian and vegan population.
