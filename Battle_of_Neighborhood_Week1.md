# Introduction of the project

All around the world people are changing their food habits. More and more are becomming vegetarians and vegans.
With this change restaurants also have to adapt and propose more solutions for clients with different needs. But even 
with the increasing demand a lot of vegetarian/vegan restaurants are closing only a few months after opening. This 
can be due to different factors, the restaurant doesn't offer enough variaty and therefore non vegetarian or vegan
client are not findind something they like when accompagning ther vegetarian friends. 
Also, the restaurant might be located in an area where the demand is low because there is already to much restaurants 
proposing this kind of option. Some neighborhood might be more friendly to this type of places because other types of venues
are attracting the same clientele around. 

The goal of this project will be to evaluate some of those factors and use them to asses if there is more suitable areas 
to open a vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Manhattan, New York.

# Description of the data used

The source of data that will be used is Foursquare. The target area for the openning of the restaurant in Manhattan, New York.
In Foursquare different information are available. The venues listed in different Neighborhoods, their names, their
categories, the ratings of the places. 
Data about already existing vegetarian and vegan restaurants will be used as well as information about other type of 
restaurant around. For example a neighborhood with only fast food and steak house around might not attrack the type of 
clients we are targeting. Also, information about other type of venues can be used, such as yoga studios and art galleries. 
This type of places tend to attract a more vegetarian and vegan population. 
Ratings of the places around can be used. A neighborhood with only bd rating places is not really attractive and avoided
by some potential customers.
